I am a first year graduate student in the University of Minnesota's department of Computer Science and Engineering's doctoral program. I am advised by Dr. Dongyeop Kang in the Minnesota NLP group. My research interest is in the development of natural language processing tools for enhancing digital libraries with fine-grained semantic information to aid researchers by improving the discoverability of peer-reviewed research.
