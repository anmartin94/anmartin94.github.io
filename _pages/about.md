Welcome! I'm Anna Martin-Boyle, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the University of Minnesota. I am a member of the [GroupLens Research Lab](https://grouplens.org/), where I am advised by [Dr. Harmanpreet Kaur](https://harmanpk.github.io/). My current research is on how LLM-augmented research interfaces might help researchers find and make sense of large volumes of scientific knowledge, with an emphasis on evaluating LLM strengths and weaknesses for longform question answering across single and multiple scholarly documents.
